# password-generator
description

This is my password generator. When you press the 'generate password' button It will go through a series of prompts and ask you questions like how long you would like your password and whether or not you want symbols, numbers, capitals, etc. After going through the prompts it will generate a password given the criteria that you input via the prompts and display it on the screen.
